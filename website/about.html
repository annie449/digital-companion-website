                        <p>Digital Companion™ exists to simplify the complex journey of loss and grief by providing compassionate, practical support when people need it most.</p>
                        
                        <p>We believe that navigating the practical and emotional aspects of loss shouldn't be an additional burden during an already difficult time. By combining technology with human-centered design, we aim to create a supportive presence that guides people through each step of their journey.</p>

                <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
                
                <div class="origin-content">
                    <p>Digital Companion™ was born from personal experience with loss and the recognition that existing support systems often fall short in addressing both the practical and emotional challenges of grief.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our founder experienced firsthand the overwhelming administrative burden that accompanies loss, all while navigating intense grief. The process was fragmented, confusing, and unnecessarily complex during an already difficult time.</p>
                    
                    <p>This experience revealed a clear need: a comprehensive support system that guides people through both the practical tasks and emotional journey of loss. Digital Companion™ was created to be the resource our founder wished had existed during that challenging time.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, we're building Digital Companion™ with input from people who have experienced loss, grief support professionals, and experts in user-centered design. Our goal is to create a truly helpful companion for life's most challenging transitions.</p>
