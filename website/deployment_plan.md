- Database for Task Storage
- API Endpoints for Task Operations
- Session Management
- Data Backup System

### 3. Infrastructure
- Web Server Configuration
- Database Server Setup
- CDN for Static Assets
- SSL Certificate Implementation
- Load Balancing (if needed)

   - Document deployment process
   - Create troubleshooting guide

## Timeline
- Day 1: Finalize code and prepare infrastructure
- Day 2: Set up production database and authentication
- Day 3: Deploy backend and frontend components
- Day 4: Conduct testing and make adjustments
- Day 5: Launch to users and begin monitoring

## Success Metrics

- Task creation and completion rates
- User engagement (time spent, return visits)
- Error rates and system performance
- User feedback and satisfaction

## Rollback Plan
In case of critical issues:
1. Identify the problem source
2. If frontend issue: roll back to previous version
3. If backend issue: restore from backup
4. If database issue: restore from latest backup
5. Communicate with users about the situation

## Next Steps After Deployment
